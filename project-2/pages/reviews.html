               <td>I don't mean to be the only person who didn't think this dish was great, but this is not a curry dish and anyone who likes and knows what a good curry dish tastes like knows this would not be considered a curry dish in any restaurant or by anyone who truly know and likes curry. I am not trying to be mean, but the tomato is just too much and it completely drowns out the flavor of the curry. The tomato needs to be cut in half and definatly add more curry powder, I added twice as much and still could barely taste it! Those who wrote that they normally don't like curry, but liked this dish obviously liked it because it's not a curry dish. It's good if it were supposed to be a creamy tomato dish, but it's just not curry at all. Those who truly like curry, I don't reccomend this, you'll be disappointed. It did have a unique and zesty flavor, so go into this not antisipating a taste of curry, but a zesty tomato flavor, kind of like a creamed marinara.</td>

               <td>This is a really easy, great-tasting recipe that my husband loves and I've received compliments on. Here are some modifications I make:
 1) I double the curry powder. (I use regular supermarket curry powder.) I do like the taste of curry to really come out, and I tend to like things spicy (though not so spicy that you can't taste the actual food).
 2) I use diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce (since I remember one reader saying that the tomato sauce overwhelms the taste of curry.
 3) Can't be bothered w/ whole cloves, cinnamon stick, etc.--I just use a pinch or two of cloves, cardamom and cinnamon.
 4) If you are on a diet, substituting plain nonfat yogurt for the coconut milk works great--just don't overheat so the yogurt doesn't curdle.</td>

               <td>I was excited to find a chicken curry recipe using coconut milk as I had had some in an Indian restaurant once and loved it. I enjoyed the recipe a lot, but I think that next time I'd cut down on the tomato sauce and increase the coconut milk.</td>
