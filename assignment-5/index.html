    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>She said I don't know
If I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty,
And I think my head is caving in

And I don't know
If I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me,
And I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry,

Well, this ain't over, no not here,
Not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change it
Yeah we just might feel good

I wanna push you around,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted,
I wanna take you for granted
I, I will, I will
I will

She said, "I don't know why you ever would lie to me.
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya.
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me.
You couldn't stand to be near me.
When my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty.

Well, don't just stand there saying nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated I've been wronged,
You, you don't know me,
Yeah well, I can't change
Well, I won't do anything at all."

I wanna push you around,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted,
I wanna take you for granted
I, I will, I will

Oh but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute
Well it kinda fell apart,
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this baby,
Don't rush this baby, baby

I wanna push you around,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna push you down,
Well, I will, well, I will
I wanna take you for granted,
I wanna take you, take you
Well, I will, well, I will
I will, I will
Well, I will, I will
I will, I will

Push you around,
And drag you down
I wanna push you around,
Well, I will
</pre>
