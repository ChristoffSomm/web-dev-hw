Alt text is a key that is used to describe an image in quotations. This helps explain the image that you are setting in your website in great detail.

I came across a form to put it in my username a password on Facebook. Forms collect information on you so you can access other features on the website. Like putting in your username and password to log in your account.  Or adding your birthday so others can see it.  Or adding email to get emails with new content.

A majority of my time was spent figuring out how to build the website. I had trouble with building the outline for the table correctly.  I didn’t know that you needed to put something in styles at the top of the page. Another issue I had was with putting the requirements for the password and username. I didn't quite fully understand what that meant. It wasn’t until I finish the website and was able to push the submit button, that I knew I did right. Overall I had a very fun time building this website and the parts that I did understand was quite fun to put together. I can't wait to work on project 2 next week.
